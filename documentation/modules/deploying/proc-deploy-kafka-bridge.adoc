= Deploying Kafka Bridge to your Kubernetes cluster

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure shows how to deploy a Kafka Bridge cluster to your Kubernetes cluster using the Cluster Operator.

The deployment uses a YAML file to provide the specification to create a `KafkaBridge` resource.

Strimzi provides xref:deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files].
In this procedure, we use the following example file:

* `examples/bridge/kafka-bridge.yaml`

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.]
