= Configuring a Strimzi deployment

[role="_abstract"]
This chapter describes how to configure different aspects of the supported deployments using custom resources:

* Kafka clusters
* Kafka Connect clusters
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge
* Cruise Control

NOTE: Labels applied to a custom resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources making up its cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.

Strimzi provides link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files^], which can serve as a starting point when building your own Kafka component configuration for deployment.

.Monitoring a Strimzi deployment
You can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Strimzi deployment.
For more information, see link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-str[Introducing metrics to Kafka^].
